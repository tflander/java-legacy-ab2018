# java-legacy-ab2018

This is sample code for a refactoring exercise.

Forked from neopragma on github, as given in an Agile and Beyond workshop in Michigan in 2018.

## Baby Step Refactor:
Assume we have a story that has something to do with the City, and we want a pristine starting point for the new story that doesn't involve fixing every code smell.
This starting point should involve extending a clean class extracted from JobApplicant.  
As we add functionality going forward, we want JobApplicant to get simpler, not more complex.

## Full Code Rescue:
Continue the baby step refactor.  Assume we want to release version 2.0 of JobApplicant, but we are not allowed to break the original contracts for Job Applicant's public methods.  This includes the Spanish parameter names.
Version 2.0 will be open-sourced, and we want to impress the developer community with our high coding standards.
